# Webserver Docker Containers
- These are the containers I built to run several services I use for my server.
	- Gitlab (git server)
	- Nextcloud (private document cloud with productivity apps, email integration, etc.)
	- Onlyoffice Open Source Microsoft Office document editing
	- Rocketchat (open source platform similar to slack)

- All run with HTTPS protection and may be deployed to domain names you own on the internet. All use CA certificates generated by a letencrypt container, and run behind an (also containerized) nginx reverse proxy. 

- All of these containers are ready-to-go. If you have purchased domain names, and have properly port-forwarded them to the IP address of your machine, go ahead and simply edit the docker-compose files to include your domain name and you'll be on your way. Run the `all-compose.sh` script to run all of these services, or take a look at it to see the commands you'll need to get the containers up and running. 

- **More documentation is forthcoming.** I will soon be detailing the specifics of how to use these containers, and describing how to link the onlyoffice and nextcloud containers together (as this requires some manual steps). I will also detail my strategy of using an nginx, letsencrypt container pair and corresponding Docker network to automate the process of certificate generation for HTTPS services. This strategy can be used to run any service you'd like online (i.e. setting up an HTTPS Jupyter Hub image, for example).
